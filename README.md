# Craft Helper for build 41.65+

This is an updated version of [Craft Helper (41.x) by b1n0m](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2186592938) with additional features and improved UI.

This mod will add a "Craft Helper 41" context menu option when right-clicking on any item with associated recipes.

Selecting that will bring up a UI with list of recipes that this item is part of, as well as ways to craft this item.
Selecting a recipe will show information about it (required items, skills etc).
Result icon and required items are right-clickable.

Detailed information about interface can be found under â“˜ (info) symbol next to close button.
<br/><br/>

Apart from item tab, there is also two new tabs:

- Search tab, where you can find all items and recipes (might be laggy with alot of mods)
- Favorite tab, where you can find all favorite ~~items~~(WIP) and recipes
